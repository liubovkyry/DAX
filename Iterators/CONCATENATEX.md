So here we have a slicer that contains product category and is filtered for coffee, coffee, beans

and drinking chocolate.

So based on this slicer selection, how could we dynamically display a label with this filter context?

Well, all we really need to do is create a measure that captures the individual values from the slicer

and then returns that output.

And we can do that using concatenate X.
