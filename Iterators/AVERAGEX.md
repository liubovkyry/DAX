The first parameter is the table, and this can be a physical table in the model or an expression that

creates a table.

This table contains all of the rows that are going to be evaluated by the expression.

So, for example, you might choose the calendar table or the product lookup table as this input or

potentially create some sort of other table based on an expression.

Next, we have the expression that we want to evaluate, right?

That's the second parameter of the average x function and some examples of the expression that you may

want to evaluate could be something like your customer sales measure or the sum of quantity sold or

the count of the rows in a table, something like that.

(Calendar table is at the daily level and we want to iterate our expression, the customer sales for

every day.)
