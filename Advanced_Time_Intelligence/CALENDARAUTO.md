<!-- So here's an example of the code that we're going to be writing.

We are first starting off here by defining the minimum and maximum years in our sales table.

And then from there, these inputs are then used with calendar auto to return the overall date range.

In addition to this, we're also using Add columns to tack on some extra columns to the output of the

table created using filter and calendar auto.

So for things like year, quarter name, quarter month number, so on and so forth.

And the output of this is the blow calendar table. -->
