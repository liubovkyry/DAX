It removes or clears filters from the specified tables or columns that are referenced within the parameters.

And the syntax of remove filters is quite simple too.

There's only one mandatory parameter, and that is either the name of a table or of a column that you

would like to clear all the filters from.

An example of this would look something like the following where we want to clear the filters from our

store lookup table.

Additionally, if you choose to remove filters from a column, you have the option to name more than

one column you'd like to remove the filters from, but they have to be from the same base table.
