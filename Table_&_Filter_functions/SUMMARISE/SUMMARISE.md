The last two parameters here I've highlighted in red, and it's because they're not recommended to be

used, they're actually depreciated.

And the purpose of these parameters is that they were set up as a way to add additional columns to the

output of the summarized table, but they're actually not being supported or no longer being optimized

by current and future updates to the Vertipaq engine so their use isn't recommended.

If you're looking to add columns to the output of a table while you're using Summarize.

A better approach would be to use something like the Add columns function.

They're being combined in a way that is showing all of the distinct or all of the unique combinations

of these two columns.
