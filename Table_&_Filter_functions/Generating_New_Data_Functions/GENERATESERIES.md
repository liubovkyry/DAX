So quick pro tip here generate series is actually a great way to build a custom range of data to be

used as a parameter input for some sort of Dax query.

You'll notice here that by using the increment value of ten, we've only made it to 49.5.

And this happens based on the increment value.

The sequence meaning these values doesn't automatically finish at the final value in this case, 50.5.

What actually happens is that the number sequence stops at the last value that is less than or equal

to the end value.

So in this case, that's why we're seeing 49.5 here.

That's one important thing to keep in mind.
