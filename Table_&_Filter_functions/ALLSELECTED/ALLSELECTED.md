All selected respects existing filter context except for row and column filters within a visual.



And oftentimes this function can be used to obtain visual totals or subtotals within a query.


One other thing here is that behind the scenes, all selected is actually a pretty complicated function

and it hides some hidden features and there's a lot going on there.


But we are going to focus on how we can use all selected to

return totals based on filter selection made within a report.

But what's happening here is that all selected is ignoring any other row or column filter context from

within the visual.

And that's why this function is commonly used to obtain visual totals or subtotals in a query.
