All selected respects existing filter context except for row and column filters within a visual.



And oftentimes this function can be used to obtain visual totals or subtotals within a query.


One other thing here is that behind the scenes, all selected is actually a pretty complicated function

and it hides some hidden features and there's a lot going on there.


But we are going to focus on how we can use all selected to

return totals based on filter selection made within a report.
